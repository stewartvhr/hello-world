This is a project from the Udacity Deep Learning course that creates and trains an LSTM - based neural network to generate an original tv script for the show 'Seinfield' based on an existing tv script. 

Seinfeld_Scripts.txt is the data used to train the LSTM - based neural network. 

dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that passes project specifications.
