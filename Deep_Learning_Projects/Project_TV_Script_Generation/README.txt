This is a project from the Udacity Deep Learning course that creates and trains an LSTM - based neural network to generate an original tv script for the show 'Seinfield' based on an existing tv script. 

Seinfeld_Scripts.txt is the data used to train the LSTM - based neural network. 

dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb is the jupyter notebook that passes project specifications. 

helper.py	is a python file containing helper functions used in dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb

problem_unittests.py	is a python file containing unit tests run to test the LSTM - based neural network. 

workspace_utils.py is a python file containing utility functions used in dlnd_tv_script_generation.ipynb
