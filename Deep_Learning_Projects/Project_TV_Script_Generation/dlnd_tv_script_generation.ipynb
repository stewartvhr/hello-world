        "My initial hyperparameters were set according to earlier coding exercises I had done in Unit 4. These hyperparameters resulted in my model decreasing from an error of about 6.5 to just over 4.1 or so. It seemed to remain at that value irrespective of how many epochs I trained the model for. After reading some recommendations for decreasing the model error on Udacity Knowledge, I decided to increase the value of batch_size to a power of 2, as the tips suggested, to 256. I also increased the values of hidden_dim to 300, as one of the tips suggested, and embedding_dim to 200. Finally, I decreased the num_layers value to 2, similar to a value of num_layers I found in the Kwowledge tips. I finally increased the number of epochs to 30. This resulted in the model error falling to about 3.9, and remaining there irrespective of the number of epochs. After playing around with the hyperparameter values and researching some more on Udacity Knowledge, decreasing the sequence_length and the learning rate brought the model error down to below 3.5 by the end of training. These final hyperparameters resulted in the aforementioned error value. "
